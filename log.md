# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed reading the JS Documentation on the CodeHelp website. Started practicing JS on FreeCodeCamp and completed my first project of a Pyramid Generator.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting a hang of the JS syntax and functionalities.

### Day 2: June 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 questions on LeetCode on practice JS for 30 days section, completed the pyramid generator officially, practiced JS functions by creating a gradeBook app in FreeCodeCamp, created a project called RPG - Game. Continued the RPG game building and it’s getting lengthy now. Completed the game now!

**Thoughts**: I'm getting a hang of the JS backend functionalities, I think so, and I'm feeling that I've accomplished something.

### Day 3: June 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Solved two LeetCode problems on setTimeout(() => {},t) functions. Completed Basic Debugging by Building a random background-color generator on FreeCodeCamp website. Completed a Calorie Counter Web Application by using HTML, CSS, and JS.

**Thoughts**: The LeetCode problems were very easy, but the descriptions were really confusing. I took the help of discussions to solve my confusion. After completing the Calorie Counter App, I learned a few things:1. About the "selected" property of the <select> HTML element. It selects the option with that attribute as the default one. Learned a lot about Regex. It is used to recognize patterns in strings, like `/\+\-\s/g` for strings like "+- Hello" or "+- Bye" but not "+Hello". For case-insensitive matching, use `/[+-\s]/i`.3. String.replace() method takes two arguments - .replace(regex or a string to find, string to replace it with).4. const regex = /[0-9]/g, recognizes and matches all strings with a single digit.5. String.match() method returns an array of the matched results.6. Regarding DOM: element.insertAdjacentHTML(position, HTML to add).7. .alert() functionfor displaying alerts or pop-ups. 8. Array.from(array-like) method for creating an array from a NodeList.

### Day 4: June 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed a Rock, Paper, and Scissors Game with the help of JS in FreeCodeCamp. [Link to the same](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#review-dom-manipulation-by-building-a-rock-paper-scissors-game). Solved 1 LeetCode problem, participated as a virtual participant in CodeForces contest. Did two questions; one got accepted and the other got Time Limit Exceeded error. Started creating the rock paper scissors game on my own.

**Thoughts**: ...

### Day 5: June 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the rock paper scissors game. Learned about Object.keys() method. Started an MP3-player project using JS in FreeCodeCamp. I learned a lot of things today:1. Promise.race(array-like) - returns the fastest promise.2. Object.keys(array-like or object) - returns the keys of an object or elements of an array.3. WebAudioAPI for playing, pausing, and shuffling songs. 4. Spread Operator creates a shallow copy.

### Day 6: June 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the MP3 player project in FreeCodeCamp. Completed making a date Formatter and a new Palindrome checker from scratch using JS. Met daily LeetCode quota of 1 problem. I learned about the Date object and various methods like .getDate(), .getMonth(), .getFullYear(), .getHours(), .getMinutes(). Learned about the "change" event listener in addEventListener function. Learned about the return type of anything typed into the <input type="text"> element. Learned about string.split() method. Learned about Object.freeze(obj) method and Object destructuring.

**Thoughts**: I don't know what I did in that project but well it's completed now. FreeCodeCamp is a good website because it provides you with a lot of projects but it’s not like you've got to do everything on your own. It provides you with certain things that make you feel like you're not doing everything by yourself, so you might feel like you're cheating. I now feel a little confident in JS and its structure. I think I'm able to think properly about the functionality now. Completed one LeetCode problem and it was very easy, but I had to think for an hour. It was me who made it complex to begin with.

### Day 7: July 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed making a To-do list using JS and localStorage concepts. I didn't understand half of it but I still did it. Completed two LeetCode questions and solved them on mostly on my own. Started working on Decimal To Binary converter on freeCodeCamp. The code is complete but we've got to make some animations now. Will complete that tomorrow.

**Thoughs**:Learned about element.classList.toggle() method, it takes a class name as an argument and removes the class if the element has the class name attached to it and adds it if the element does not have that class name attached to it. I learned about the dialog element. It is used to make pop-up dialog boxes on the web. It has showModal() and closeModal() methods which are used to how and close the dialog box. Then there is the array.findIndex() method, which takes a callBack function as an argument and returns the index of the first element that matches the criteria of the callBack funciton. Then there is the Date.now() method which returns the time elapsed in milliseconds since January 1970 or something. Then I learned about the localStorage.setItem("key",JSON.stringify(data)); Watched 30 minutes of the Lex Fridman podcast and boom my mind opened up. It is my fuel bascially. <strong>"keydown"</strong> is a new event which says that a key has been pressed. Whenever an event occurs an Event Object is automatically created. In that event object there is a property called <strong>"key"</strong>, using that we can add functionality that what will happen if we press "Enter" key or "1" key or any other key that we want. Learned about the parseInt() function. All the HTML elements return a string and to convert it into an integer or a <strong>Number</strong>, we used the parseInt() function provided by JS. Then there is the isNaN() function that returns true if we pass anything equivalent to NaN and false otherwise. Then there is the String(arg) function which converts whatever arg passed into it into a string. Thats it!


### Day 8: July 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the decimal to binary animation thing. Opened two issues on Github under GSSoC'24. Got assigned one issue.

**Thoughts**: It was a waste of time really to complete the animation part, nothing to learn there.

### Day 9: July 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added a lot of functionalities to the Dragon Slayer game. Now I need to add the funtionality for attack and dodge and run for each monster. Also got assigned another issue: Zoom in and out feature which I requested.

**Thoughts**: The game is going pretty well and I'm confident I'll finish it well in time. About the zoom in and out issue which I got assigned, man I don't know how to approach that shit and I've tried it, spent like 2 hours on it but cannot figure out what to do with it. I've posted it on StackOverflow and if nothing happens I'm going to just close the issue. 


### Day 10: July 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: The Dragon Slayer game is now feature complete and I'm going to add some details to it. Updated my GitHub profile with the trophies section. Revised about the String.replace() method. Completed one LeetCode problem based on Array merging, I didn't understand the concept and copied the solutions from the discussions section today. Completed the roman numeral convertor using JS

**Thoughts**: I'm a little more comfortable with JS now that I've done a couple of projects.


### Day 11: July 5, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Did nothing today. 

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 12: July 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Participated in LeetCode Biweekly contest and could not do a single problem.

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 13: July 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started learning JS by practicing making a spam message checker in freeCodeCamp. Learnings - 1. string.match() method, it takes a regex as argument and determines if the string matches the regex or not. 2. regex.test() method, this method takes a string as an argument and returns true if the string matches the regex and false otherwise. 3. In the character class of a regex, you can use the "|" operator to match either this or that pattern. 4. array.some() method, it takes a function as argument and returns true if atleast one element of the array matches the function's conditions. 5. Capture groups are a way to define a part of an expression that will be captured and stored for later referrences.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 21: July 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressing through the sheet formater project using JS.

### Day 22: July 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Restarting the sheet formater project. Completed the project. 

**Thoughts**: I realized I was not making any progress over this past week because of a wedding, so I decided to restart my sheet formatter project. I did not understand anything after some evalFormula function in the project, so it was just a race to complete the project.

### Day 23: July 17, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Completed the US Phone number validator project

**Thoughts**: Understood the regex. I provided the base foundations and just copied the regex required. I tried it first myself and could not figure it out so chat-gpted it and done!

### Day 24: July 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed a shopping cart project by using concepts of OOPs in JS. JS uses classes similar to C++. It has a class keyword followed by a class name using Pascal Case of naming. I learned about constructors, in JS a constructor is defined by the constructor(parameters) keyword. There is the this keyword which is used to access the object of a class. There is a confirm() built-in function just like alert() which is used for confirmation of an event. 

**Thoughts**:
